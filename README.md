##### Alexa configuration
Go to the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/) and select _Alexa Skill Kit_.
Click on _Add new skill_.

The next steps are the information necesary on each Alexa tab. If you notice there is information _missing_ just leave that fields blank or their default values.

* You will get the endpoint using ngrok. Check the next step for that.

##### Getting local endpoint
In your terminal run
`ngrok http 8081`
You will get a https endpoint, that is the hook for your skill.

###### CouchDB configuration
Before running the project, is recommended to have CouchDB running.
By default, it runs on port _5984_.
- Open you manager ( http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/ ), and under the admin panel create a new admin. Remember this credentials.
- Log out from CouchDB by clicking _Log out_ just at the bottom of the page, left side.
- Open again the manager and log in with your credentials.
- Go to _Databases_ and _Create Database_.
- Input the name of your desired Database and click _Create_. Super easy, right? _Relax_.


##### Setting up the project
- Within your terminal clone the project, and cd the project directory.
- Copy _./Sources/AppConstants.swift.example_ as _./Sources/AppConstants.swift_
- Edit that file by adding your LoL API Key in the _apiKey_ filed.
- Edit the host and port of the database if it doesn't match with your configuration.
- Add the name of the database in the _name_ field, also input your _admin_ and _password_ database in their respective fields.

##### Building and running the project
You can install dependences and build project with
`swift build`

If success, you can run the project with
`./.build/debug/SwiftEcho`
Your server will be running into the port 8081.

Also, you can generate the xcode project using.
`swift package generate-xcodeproj`

* Note, if you are coding withing xode, be sure to change the scheme before running. You should select the last _SwiftEcho_, and run on _My Mac_.

#### Testing the skill
Back in the Alexa portal, we have the _Test_ tab under your skill configuration. Go there.
In the Service simulatour you can try different stuff to test your skill.
Some examples are:
`open league asistant`
`log in with ID two zero eight one seven three eight and region Latin America North`
`give me statistics`
